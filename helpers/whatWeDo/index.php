                            We have designed simplified training materials grounded
                            on adult learning theories and we use age appropriate
                            methodologies to make learning more joyful and enjoyable
                            for young people. Our training packages incorporate on-going
                            mentorship to ensure that gained knowledge is sustained and
                            skills are put into practice and become part of day to day life of women and girls.

                                Our learning approaches are grounded on theories from
                                various scholars that, learning cannot occur without
                                dialogue and reflection. Reading and listening are not
                                enough. Interaction is required. We believe that, the
                                process of putting ideas into words is itself an important
                                form of active engagement with the content, and a way of
                                growing knowledge (even without feedback). If you have never
                                expressed something in your own words, you do not know it
                                fully. Dialogue is a great way for women and girls to reveal
                                themselves in the words they use and the way those words are
                                delivered. Dialogues spark existing conflicts which would
                                otherwise remain obscured. The conflict can be external—character
                                vs. character or character vs. environment—or the dialogue can reflect
                                the viewpoint character’s internal struggle. We have used these
                                theories to develop a dialogue guide which stimulate self-expression
                                and interactions among peers. By fostering on-going dialogue
                                and participation, women, girls or their influencers can cultivate
                                a deeper understanding of local norms and beliefs, thus laying
                                the groundwork for sustainable behavior change.

                                Our organization strongly believe that domestic government
                                spending on family planning should become the mainstay of
                                a country’s family planning program, providing a budgeted
                                flow of funds for services and staff. Our advocacy efforts
                                have therefore focused on working with regional, districts
                                and health facilities to increase allocations, disbursement
                                and utilization of resources for family planning,
                                adolescents’ friendly SRH services and SRH services
                                for people with disabilities.

                                Our organization believes that women and girls are experts
                                of their own needs and therefore meaningful engagement and
                                involvement of women in policy development, planning, budgeting
                                and all SRH interventions is paramount. Our interventions are
                                focused on building the capacity of women and girls led civil
                                society organizations (CSOs) to lead and fully participate
                                in SRH policy making and programming. We strengthen the ability
                                of CSOs to advocate for quality and equitable SRH information
                                and services and hold the government accountable on its SRH
                                commitments.

                                <span style="color: #F27D2D; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Innovative programming: </span>
                                Our interventions always seek creation and implementation of new
                                and creative methods and techniques which will enhance our efficiency
                                and effectiveness in reaching more women and girls. We constantly
                                seek feedback from our beneficiaries to learn what is working
                                and what is not, and redesign our approaches to ensure that more
                                women and girls are reached. We constantly explore new technology
                                and take advantage of technological advancement to improve both reach
                                and the impact of our interventions.

                                In our organization, prioritizing depth over mere target achievement
                                is paramount. Rather than focusing solely on hitting numerical goals,
                                deliberate efforts are made in the design and implementation of the
                                program towards fostering genuine understanding and empathy among women
                                and girls. This entails tailoring interventions to address the multifaceted
                                layers of social and gender norms, integrating culturally sensitive
                                approaches that resonate with local contexts. Through this approach,
                                the seeds of transformation can take root, paving the way for meaningful
                                shifts in attitudes and behaviors among women, girls and their influencers.

                                Gender Equality and Social Inclusion (GESI) is a corner stone of our programming.
                                Our programme activities are designed with both practical and strategic needs of
                                women and girls, and other excluded groups in mind. The interventions,
                                therefore aim at shifting social norms and power dynamics to ensure women
                                and girls and other excluded groups can enjoy their rights, and have equal
                                access to and control over assets, resources and services.

                                <span style="color: #F27D2D; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Institutionalized intersectionality: </span>
                                Our interventions always seek to understand the ways that multiple forms of
                                inequality or disadvantage sometimes compound themselves and create
                                obstacles that often are not understood among conventional ways of
                                thinking. The design of our program strongly considers how groups' and
                                individuals' social and political identities result in unique combinations
                                of discrimination and privilege. Examples of these factors include gender,
                                caste, sex, race, ethnicity, class, sexuality, religion, disability,
                                height, age, weight and physical appearance. We therefore design programs
                                which cut across multiple social and political entities of an individual
                                and empower them to improve various aspects of their lives.
