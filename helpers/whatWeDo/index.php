                        We have designed simplified training materials grounded
                        on adult learning theories and we use age appropriate
                        methodologies to make learning more joyful and enjoyable
                        for young people. Our training packages incorporate on-going
                        mentorship to ensure that gained knowledge is sustained and
                        skills are put into practice and become part of day to day life of women and girls.

                        Our learning approaches are grounded on theories from
                        various scholars that, learning cannot occur without
                        dialogue and reflection. Reading and listening are not
                        enough. Interaction is required. We believe that, the
                        process of putting ideas into words is itself an important
                        form of active engagement with the content, and a way of
                        growing knowledge (even without feedback). If you have never
                        expressed something in your own words, you do not know it
                        fully. Dialogue is a great way for women and girls to reveal
                        themselves in the words they use and the way those words are
                        delivered. Dialogues spark existing conflicts which would
                        otherwise remain obscured. The conflict can be external—character
                        vs. character or character vs. environment—or the dialogue can reflect
                        the viewpoint character’s internal struggle. We have used these
                        theories to develop a dialogue guide which stimulate self-expression
                        and interactions among peers. By fostering on-going dialogue
                        and participation, women, girls or their influencers can cultivate
                        a deeper understanding of local norms and beliefs, thus laying
                        the groundwork for sustainable behavior change.
