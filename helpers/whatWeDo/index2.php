This entails tailoring interventions to address the multifaceted layers of social and gender norms, integrating culturally sensitive approaches that resonate with local contexts. Through this approach, the seeds of transformation can take root, paving the way for meaningful shifts in attitudes and behaviors among women, girls and their influencers.</p>

                <p>Our interventions always seek to understand the ways that multiple forms of inequality or disadvantage sometimes compound themselves and create obstacles that often are not understood among conventional ways of thinking. The design of our program strongly considers how groups' and individuals' social and political identities result in unique combinations of discrimination and privilege. Examples of these factors include gender, caste, sex, race, ethnicity, class, sexuality, religion, disability, height, age, weight and physical appearance. We therefore design programs which cut across multiple social and political entities of an individual and empower them to improve various aspects of their lives.</p>
